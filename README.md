# J-Clasifier

I have to make a Online Reputation Report every single day at my work and in this report(wich it's made in excel) i have to order every row depending of the corresponding department.

That's why i made this simple software that takes a .xls file and return you a ordened version of it. The mentioned .xls returned file is ordened based in the company requeriments that I currently work at.

So now, instead of expending 30 mins ordening the .xls file I just do couple of clicks and it's done.

I also used this project for practising JavaFX.
